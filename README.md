# Temporary-blog
This is a blog using bootstrap for the user interface. Used to be able to focus more on the backend using node. The blog will not be saved as there is no database, it is only temporary. You can create, load, edit delete posts. 
If you intend to use it you need to unzip the node_modulde file. otherwise you can use npm i in the terminal to install all the necessary frameworks for node.js
